Symmetric cryptography involves two different keys.

A: False.

Which of the following of these is not a crypto system we have discussed in class

A: Private Key.

Cryptographic operations always require a reverse operation.

A: False

Which of the following are needed for an effective cryptographic operation

A: Algorithm, Key , Secrecy

Networking technology leverages a layered approach.

A:True

Which of the following is added to the beginning of a payload before information is passed down the network stack?

A: Header

Which of the following are valid fields in the IPv4 header (mark all that apply).

A: The version, which for IPv4 is always 4, Header length, which usually indicates a header size of 20, Protocol, which indicates the protocol type of the payload (ex. ICMP, UDP, TCP), Source address, which indicates the source address of the packet

An IPv6 header is always 48 bytes in length.

A: False

Routing protocols that are slow to converge, use aggregation to limit the number of known prefixes, provide bulk updates to configured neighbors and support knowledge of multiple ASNs would fall into which category (select the one best option)

A: External

IP addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6 are made up of two parts: network ID and host ID.

A. True

In order to encrypt messages larger than our key size (with secret keys), we need to run the encryption operation separately over key size chunks of the message.

A. True

How many UNIQUE keys does 3DES use?
  
A. 2

Which of the following are public key encryption algorithms (mark all that apply)?

A. DSS, RSA		

Match the element of RSA with its description

n: Block value used as the basis for modular arithmetic in our calculations (also used as part of the public key)

p and q: Principle values used to create the value of n used in modular mathematical operations

d: Private key component used to decrypt messages and generate signatures

e: Public key component used to encrypt messages and verify signatures

Which of the following are tools that we can use to capture and analyze network traffic?

A: TCPDUMP, Wireshark	

Hashing is a destructive operation that cannot be undone.

A. True

Which of the following can be implemented with hashing (mark all that apply)?
 
A. Message digests	
 
B. Encryption (by creating a stream cipher pad)	

C. Secure storage of credentials (like passwords)	

The ICMP protocol should be blocked completely for security reasons.

A. False

Wireshark is a reasonable alternative to using tcpdump for packet capture and analysis?

A:True

The first two bytes of an IP v4 packet with no special options or extensions of the standard IP header would be which of the following?

A. 45

Match the following IP protocols with their representation inside an IP packet header.

ICMP - 01

TCP - 06

UDP - 11

Which of the following are implemented using ICMP?
 
 A. Notice that the traffic that you sent was not able to arrive before it expired in transit with a TTL Expired message	
 
 B. Checking if a host is alive using Echo Request	
 
 C. Identify the size of a subnet with a Subnet Request message	
 
 D. Notice that traffic has been prevented from reaching the destination using Administratively Prohibited message	
 
 E. Notice that a host is not online with a Host Unreachable message
 
 (All are true)
