Symmetric cryptography involves two different keys.

A: False.

Which of the following of these is not a crypto system we have discussed in class

A: Private Key.

Cryptographic operations always require a reverse operation.

A: False

Which of the following are needed for an effective cryptographic operation

A:Algorithm, Key , Secrecy

Networking technology leverages a layered approach.

A:True

Which of the following is added to the beginning of a payload before information is passed down the network stack?

A: Header

Which of the following are valid fields in the IPv4 header (mark all that apply).

A: The version, which for IPv4 is always 4, Header length, which usually indicates a header size of 20, Protocol, which indicates the protocol type of the payload (ex. ICMP, UDP, TCP), Source address, which indicates the source address of the packet

An IPv6 header is always 48 bytes in length.

A: False

Routing protocols that are slow to converge, use aggregation to limit the number of known prefixes, provide bulk updates to configured neighbors and support knowledge of multiple ASNs would fall into which category (select the one best option)

A: External

IP addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6 are made up of two parts: network ID and host ID.

A. True

In order to encrypt messages larger than our key size (with secret keys), we need to run the encryption operation separately over key size chunks of the message.

A. True

n: Block value used as the basis for modular arithmetic in our calculations (also used as part of the public key)

p and q: Principle values used to create the value of n used in modular mathematical operations

d: Private key component used to decrypt messages and generate signatures

e: Public key component used to encrypt messages and verify signatures
